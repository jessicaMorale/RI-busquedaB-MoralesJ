 figments of our imaginations?  the\\n: evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming, but i won't bother with\\n: most evidence at the moment.\\n\\nyou would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are\\nactaully there - as perceived? this may be interesting. i thought\\nthat an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of \\\"light\\\"\\ncan illuminate any \\\"object\\\" of atomic scale. if this image is to have\\nuseful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have\\nto be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?\\n\\nif an atom is a \\\"probablity cloud\\\", lower resolutions would give the\\nappearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is\\nnot an object is any conventional sense. obviously i am not a\\nphysicist, but the question does have ramification of a philosophic\\nnature. anyway, just a stray thought, carry on ...\",\n          \"\\n\\nthat's a good way to put it.  it's a quiet confidence.  i don't feel like\\ni have to defend this team anymore. \\n\\nthe devils are a puzzle to me.  they have long been one of the few teams\\ni always dreaded playing.  their d isn't quite what it used to be but they\\nstill usually play us pretty tough.  i just can't figure it out.  at least\\nlast night they mounted an attack.\\n\\n\\nbernie nichols was interviewed after game 2 on the late news.  he was\\nshaking his head in disbelief over barrasso, saying that tommy is like\\nanother defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.\\nthen he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing\\noff and he said, \\\"it just isn't right...it just isn't fair...\\\" and he\\ntried to muster a smile.\\n\\n\\nas far as coaching goes, a pens/islanders match-up should be pretty good.\\n\\none guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri.  i'm sure\\ntom barrasso knows how he feels.  for so long tommy would look up and not\\nhave a teammate in sight.  terreri's teammates really left him out in the\\ncold in the first two games.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"regex_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stopword\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stemmed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lemmatized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prep_doc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18219,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"i have an adcom gfa that i got in there certainli isn t anyth magic about it the compon use are decent but noth uncommon with respect to consum grade compon the gfa is a nice piec of equip i m glad that adcom had the gut to not over do the packag it irk me when i see audiophil orient equip whose case and heat sink probabl cost much more and receiv more attent than the electron they are suppos to serv i don t see ani big deal about the geograph region in which someth is assembl thi is especi true for someth a low technolog a a gfa i d hope that a gfa would still work well after sever year except under condit of extrem abus there isn t much there to go wrong\",\n          \"there are other law and direct which bear upon the subject for exampl the nation comput secur act of specif direct nb sic to work with nsa on develop secur standard for civilian feder comput pick up the bill from cpsr org it also includ a report describ it and some of the legisl histori includ concern about nsa s involv note also that nsa is specif charg with run the nation comput secur center to quot the aforement report nsa also will work with industri at the dod comput secur center to develop secur standard for privat sector use\",\n          \"hi i have a problem with my floppi drive in an effort to make my drive normal b my a drive i switch the order of connect on the cabl from the serial card floppi ide control i boot up chang the cmo set to reflect the a drive a the and the b drive a the the drive light didn t come on and there wa a failur tri to read from those drive i switch the cabl back to their origin posit and then boot up and restor the origin cmo set the light for the floppi came on dure thi process and they stay on for a long a the comput is on i see that when there is a disk in a the drive is spin yet there seem to be no disk access msd exe and norton si detect both drive but when i tri to get detail inform about a or b norton si tell me that there is no disk in the drive can anyon offer ani suggest i m in desper need of help thank you for your time\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
