It then **learns patterns** from this data (e.g., common words, sender details, email structure) to **predict** whether a new, unseen email is spam. It gets better at this prediction over time as it processes more emails and learns from your feedback (marking something as \"not spam\").\n"

            "2.  **Interpretation:** History is not a simple collection of facts. Historians interpret evidence, consider different perspectives, and debate the meaning and significance of past events. Bias (conscious or unconscious) can exist in sources and interpretations, making critical thinking essential.\n",
