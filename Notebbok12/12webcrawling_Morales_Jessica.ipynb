            "2. Here's what you'll need to make rotisserie chicken at home:\n",
            "3. · Whole Chicken: This recipe is meant for a whole 3-pound chicken. If your chicken is larger or smaller, you'll have to adjust the cooking time.· Butter: Butter keeps the chicken moist and juicy, while giving the seasonings something to stick to.· Seasonings: The rotisserie chicken is simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika.\n",
            "4. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this rotisserie chicken:\n",

            "7. Allow the chicken to cool for about 15 minutes before carving. To carve:\n",
            "8. 1. Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a cutting board.2. Pull one of the legs away from the body and slice through the meat until the hip bone is exposed. Then, pull the leg harder until the leg is detached.3. Use your knife to separate the drumstick and thigh.4. Pull the wing tip away from the breast until you can easily cut through the joint.5. Slice one of the breasts away from the breastbone. Repeat with the other breast.\n",
            "9. If you go through the trouble of making a rotisserie chicken at home, you'll likely want to enjoy it on its own with a side salad or roasted vegetables.\n",

            "15. \"This is the best rotisserie chicken I've made, and I'll add, also beats baked,\" raves Melissa M. \"Very juicy, done right, and great flavor. I put liquid smoke, pineapple juice and water in a pan underneath to add more moisture, and basted with butter and basil pesto every 30-45 min.\"\n",
            "16. \"We just got a new grill along with a rotisserie,\" says Dishy. \"Couldn't wait to try it out and this recipe was perfect. I even did two chickens (Doubled the recipe) at one time and they both turned out great. Very moist and flavorful!\"\n",
